# General

This addon is used to create an knx.yaml file which is compatible with the [KNX Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/knx/).

It is using user defined rules to identify the knx entities.

For more details, please see the [documentation](knx-yaml-generator/DOCS.md)

As it is my first addon that I've mainly created for me, it doesn't come with pre-generated docker container.
Home Assistant can create them on its own.

I'm using an Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant OS.
